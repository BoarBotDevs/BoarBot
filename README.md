### Blessings
This stat determines how likely you are to get rarer boars and more boars when a player collects their daily boar(s). You can read more about the sources for these in using the /boar help command in the bot. The formula is for the chances to get different boars is quite complex, however you can view it <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/74inrkixxa">here.

## Powerups
Powerups are the main ways that a player can influence what boars they have and what boars they get. They are mainly obtained from powerup events and the weekly quests.

### Charms
These massively boost your blessings, but are temporary and will disappear after you use your daily boar once after you activate them. They will boost your blessings amount by 10% compounding, but will cap at 1000 blessings per miracle charm. These are the only way to get very large blessing counts.

### Clones
Clones will allow a player to duplicate a boar they already have. The rarer the boar, the more clones it takes!

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae8f5483-de55-482e-93c3-30c3dbe50d4b" alt="shows the confirmation screen for using clones. text in the middle says: Are you sure? This will use 3 cloning serums, granting you 3 bors.">

### Gifts
Gifts can be sent in a server and are opened by a player in that server. The fastest player to open the gift wins! They can be sent either in the powerups menu, or by using the /boar gift command. You can get powerups, boars and boar bucks from these gifts. If you're lucky, you may even get a special item...

### Transmutation Charges
Transmutation Charges allows a user to upgrade their boar to a random boar of a higher rarity. The higher the rarity, the more charges you need. These are the most elusive powerups, and can only be obtained by quests, gifts, or given on special occasions. You can have 30 of these at once.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/797c9025-1913-41fd-bae2-619a53674a38" alt="shows the confirmation screen for using transmutation charges. text in the middle says: Are you sure? This will completely drain your transmutation cell and will replace one of your Minimum Wage Boars with a random Mythic Boar.">

# Hunts
BoarBot will sometimes have hunts in order to get special boars. Every year, there's scheduled hunts around Halloween, and may occur irregularrly at other times.

# Other Commands
Along with the main commands listed above, BoarBot has a few more minor commands that aren't used often or aren't very important.
